**Note:**

- To broaden the analysis, consider including hybrid/onsite roles for comparison.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    sd.skills,
    sd.type AS skill_type,
    COUNT(sjd.job_id) AS demand_count,
    jf.job_work_from_home
FROM
    skills_job_dim sjd
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
INNER JOIN
    job_postings_fact jf ON sjd.job_id = jf.job_id
WHERE
    jf.job_work_from_home = 'Yes'
    AND jf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    sd.skills, sd.type, jf.job_work_from_home
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

| Skills   | Skill Type    | Demand Count |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| sql      | Programming   | 7291         |
| Excel    | Analyst Tools | 4611         |
| Python   | Programming   | 4330         |

## 2. Average Yearly Salary by Role and Country üíµüåç

**What it does:**

- Aggregates job postings by job title and country.
- Calculates the average yearly salary for each group, rounding up to the nearest integer.
- Filters out postings where the yearly salary is missing.
- Orders the results by the highest average yearly salary.

**Insights:**

- See which job titles and countries offer the highest average yearly salaries.
- Identify geographic or role-based trends in yearly salary offerings.

- **Job Seekers:** Target roles and locations with higher average yearly salaries.
- **Employers:** Benchmark your yearly salary offerings against market averages.
- **Educators/Trainers:** Advise students on lucrative career paths and locations.

**Note:**

- The query only considers postings with a specified yearly salary (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`).

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    job_title_short,
    job_country,
    CEIL(AVG(salary_year_avg)) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    job_title_short, job_country
ORDER BY
    avg_yearly_salary DESC;
```

## 3. Top Remote Employers by Year üè¢üåê

**What it does:**

- Joins job postings with company information.
- Filters for jobs that are remote (`job_work_from_home = TRUE`).
- Groups results by company name and the year the job was posted.

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    cd.name AS company_name,
    COUNT(jpf.company_id) AS remote_job_count,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM jpf.job_posted_date) AS year_posted
FROM
    job_postings_fact jpf
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim cd ON jpf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE
    jpf.job_work_from_home = 'true'
GROUP BY
    company_name, year_posted
ORDER BY
    remote_job_count DESC;

## 4. Degree Requirement and Salary Analysis üéìüí∏

**What it does:**

- Groups job postings based on whether a degree is mentioned as a requirement (`job_no_degree_mention`).
- Calculates the average yearly salary for each group, considering only postings with a non-null yearly salary.
- Counts the number of job postings in each group.

**Insights:**

- See if jobs that do not require a degree tend to offer higher or lower average salaries.

**Use cases:**

- **Job Seekers:** Assess whether pursuing roles that do not require a degree impacts potential earnings.
- **Employers:** Benchmark your job requirements and salary offerings against market trends.
- **Educators/Trainers:** Advise students on the value of a degree in relation to salary expectations.

**Note:**

- The analysis only includes jobs with a specified yearly salary (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`).

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    job_no_degree_mention AS no_degree_mentioned,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary,
    COUNT(*) AS job_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    job_no_degree_mention;
