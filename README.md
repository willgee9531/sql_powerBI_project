- **Employers:** Ensure job descriptions include the most sought-after skills to attract qualified candidates.
- **Educators/Trainers:** Tailor curriculum to emphasize the most in-demand skills for remote Data Analyst positions.

**Note:**
- To broaden the analysis, consider including hybrid/onsite roles for comparison.

**SQL Query:**
````sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    sd.skills,
    sd.type AS skill_type,
    COUNT(sjd.job_id) AS demand_count,
    jf.job_work_from_home
FROM 
    skills_job_dim sjd
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
INNER JOIN 
    job_postings_fact jf ON sjd.job_id = jf.job_id
WHERE
    jf.job_work_from_home = 'Yes'
    AND jf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY 
    sd.skills, sd.type, jf.job_work_from_home
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

## 2. Average Yearly Salary by Role and Country üíµüåç

**What it does:**
- Aggregates job postings by job title and country.
- Calculates the average yearly salary for each group, rounding up to the nearest integer.
- Filters out postings where the yearly salary is missing.
- Orders the results by the highest average yearly salary.

**Insights:**
- See which job titles and countries offer the highest average yearly salaries.
- Identify geographic or role-based trends in yearly salary offerings.

**Use cases:**
- **Job Seekers:** Target roles and locations with higher average yearly salaries.
- **Employers:** Benchmark your yearly salary offerings against market averages.
- **Educators/Trainers:** Advise students on lucrative career paths and locations.

**Note:**
- The query only considers postings with a specified yearly salary (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`).

**SQL Query:**
````sql
SELECT 
    job_title_short,
    job_country,
    CEIL(AVG(salary_year_avg)) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    job_title_short, job_country
ORDER BY 
    avg_yearly_salary DESC;
````

## 3. Top Remote Employers by Year üè¢üåê

**What it does:**
- Joins job postings with company information.
- Filters for jobs that are remote (`job_work_from_home = TRUE`).
- Groups results by company name and the year the job was posted.
- Counts the number of remote jobs posted by each company per year.
- Orders the results to show companies with the most remote jobs at the top.

**Insights:**

- **Researchers:** Analyze the growth and distribution of remote work opportunities by company and year.

**Note:**
- The query only considers jobs explicitly marked as remote (`job_work_from_home = TRUE`).
- Companies with hybrid or flexible arrangements not marked as remote may be underrepresented.

**SQL Query:**
````sql
SELECT 
    cd.name AS company_name,
    COUNT(jf.job_id) AS remote_jobs,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM jf.job_posted_date) AS year
FROM 
    job_postings_fact jf
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim cd ON jf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE 
    jf.job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY 
    cd.name, year
ORDER BY 
    remote_jobs DESC;

## 4. Degree Requirement and Salary Analysis üéìüí∏

**What it does:**
- Groups job postings based on whether a degree is mentioned as a requirement (`job_no_degree_mention`).
- Calculates the average yearly salary for each group, considering only postings with a non-null yearly salary.
- Counts the number of job postings in each group.

**Insights:**
- See if jobs that do not require a degree tend to offer higher or lower average salaries.
- Understand how common it is for jobs to omit degree requirements and how that relates to compensation.

**Use cases:**
- **Job Seekers:** Assess whether pursuing roles that do not require a degree impacts potential earnings.
- **Employers:** Benchmark your job requirements and salary offerings against market trends.
- **Educators/Trainers:** Advise students on the value of a degree in relation to salary expectations.

**Note:**
- The analysis only includes jobs with a specified yearly salary (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`).

**SQL Query:**
````sql
SELECT 
    job_no_degree_mention,
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_salary,
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    job_no_degree_mention;
````
